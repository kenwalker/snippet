snippet
=======

This is an Eclipse Orion plugin to create an HTML Snippet that will display the selected text in an editor.

You can view the [Snippet Orion Plugin](http://kenwalker.github.com/snippet/Snippet.html "Orion Snippet Plugin") on GitHub.

After installing the plugin there will be a new button in the text editor labelled "Snippet". Select some text editor and press it. A new section of text will be inserted into the editor containing an entire HTML Snippet that when inserted into your blog should display the selected text in a read-only version of the Orion Editor.

Copy or Cut the text into the clipboard and paste into your raw HTML blog post.

Needed Features
