snippet
=======

This is an Eclipse Orion plugin to create an HTML Snippet that will display the selected text inside an Orion editor on your blog or web page.

You can view the [Snippet Orion Plugin](http://kenwalker.github.com/snippet/Snippet.html "Orion Snippet Plugin") on GitHub.

After installing the plugin there will be a new button in the text editor labelled "Snippet". Select some text editor and press it. A new section of text will be inserted into the editor containing an entire HTML Snippet that when inserted into your blog should display the selected text in a read-only version of the Orion Editor.

Copy or Cut the text into the clipboard and paste into your raw HTML blog post.
